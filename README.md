# Smile-Detector

The Smile Detector is built using the Haar Cascades available on https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

You need 3 cascades to run this code from the above link, I suggest you to download those

1.haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

2.haarcascade_eye.xml

3.haarcascade_smile.xml

and You are done you can use this code as it is,

It is the simplest code available for face detection on this world, lol:P
